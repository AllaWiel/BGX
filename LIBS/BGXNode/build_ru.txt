How to build bgxnetwork system
=========================================

This document describes the necessary components and the process of building the bgxnetwork project

The project build system uses:
1. Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)
Ant comes in the form of a zip archive. It must be unzipped to any place.

2. JBoss. Formally, only the libraries that are part of JBOSS are needed for the assembly.
Jboss comes in the form of a zip archive. It must be unzipped to any place.

3. JDK (http://java.sun.com). JDK is supplied as an installer.

Install the above applications and products before continuing.


Building (Build)
--------------

To get started, you need to get the source code of the project from the perfor- mance:
server: docs.bgx.ai:1666
path: // depot / External Projects / i9500 / Implementation / Source /

A further description assumes that the source code has already been received.

1. Edit the environment variables.

\ depot \ External Projects \ i9500 \ Implementation \ Source \ build-alpha-6.bat


Attention!!!
the environment variable JIBX_LIB must not contain a space in the path
Therefore, after getting the code from perforce, you need to copy
catalog
\ depot \ External Projects \ i9500 \ Implementation \ Source \ lib \ jibx \
to disk in the directory, the path to the person does not contain a space
and this is the path specified in the variable JIBX_LIB

eg:

JIBX_LIB = D: \ jibx \ lib \


2. Building (build)
To build, run the .bat file
The last line of the file determines which of the assemblies is started by alpha or devel

ant alpha - to build a project with a server configuration on port 8080
ant devel - to build a project with a server configuration on port 8585

Deployment
-----------------------
1. Stop the JBoss server
2. Put the contents of the folder D: \ depot \ MNS \ bgxnetwork-2.1 ??\ deploy-alpha in the folder server + \ server \ QL \ QL \
3. Run the JBoss server
